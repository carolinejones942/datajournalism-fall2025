# Final Project Data
## by Caroline Jones, Sophie Liebeck, and Sara Voneisengrein
1. Link to original story: [Washington Post data - Homeschooling on the state level](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling/blob/main/home_school_state.csv)

2. This data set was straightforward and no cleaning was necessary.
3. Our question was: "Which school year saw the most growth in homeschool participation in D.C.?"
   1. This question has newsworthiness for the AU campus for a few reasons. Firstly, it is specific to the a local area, D.C. Secondly, homeschool growth is newsworthy to track because education is deeply important to the state of our democracy in America. In other words, how children are educated in America will have a direct impact on our nation as a whole. Finally, this question is newsworthy because it relates to the how the COVID-19 pandemic could have affected homeschool participation numbers.
4. Steps taken to answer question / create pivot table
   1. The "state" heading was put under "Filters" and filtered to D.C.
   2. The "year" column was put under "Rows".
   3. The "homeschool_students" heading was put under "Values" and changed to sum, instead of count.
   4. I right-clicked the column with the sum of homeschool students and selected "Value Field Settings"
   5. I selected "Show Values As", and set the "Base Field" to "year" and the "Base item" to "previous", so that the table showed percentage changes.
   6. I then made another pivot table following steps i-iii.
   7. I compared the tables to ensure that excel was doing the math correctly.
   8. I found the school year with the highest percentage change from the previous year to answer the question.
5. The answer to our question was that the school year with the most growth from the previous year was the 2020-21 year. It had a 196.40% increase in homeschool participation from the 2019-20 school year.
