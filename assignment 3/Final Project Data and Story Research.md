# Final Project Data

1. Link to original story: [Washington Post data - Homeschooling on the state level](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling/blob/main/home_school_state.csv)

2. This data set was straightforward and no cleaning was necessary.
3. Our question was: "Which school year saw the most growth in homeschool participation in D.C.?"
   1. This question has newsworthiness for the AU campus for a few reasons. Firstly, it is specific to the a local area, D.C. Secondly, homeschool growth is newsworthy to track because education is deeply important to the state of our democracy in America. In other words, how children are educated in America will have a direct impact on our nation as a whole. Finally, this question is newsworthy because it relates to the how the COVID-19 pandemic could have affected homeschool participation numbers.
4. Steps taken to answer question / create pivot table
   1. The "state" heading was put under "Filters" and filtered to D.C.
   2. The "year" column was put under "Rows".
   3. The "homeschool_students" heading was put under "Values" and changed to sum, instead of count.
   4. I right-clicked the column with the sum of homeschool students and selected "Value Field Settings"
   5. I selected "Show Values As", and set the "Base Field" to "year" and the "Base item" to "previous", so that the table showed percentage changes.
   6. I then made another pivot table following steps i-iii.
   7. I compared the tables to ensure that excel was doing the math correctly.
   8. I found the school year with the highest percentage change from the previous year to answer the question.
5. The answer to our question was that the school year with the most growth from the previous year was the 2020-21 year. It had a 196.40% increase in homeschool participation from the 2019-20 school year.

### Summary of stories related to homeschool growth

Links to stories:
1. [Johns Hopkins University - Homeschool Growth: 2023-2024](https://education.jhu.edu/edpolicy/policy-research-initiatives/homeschool-hub/homeschool-growth-2023-2024/)
2. [Education Next - New U.S. Census Bureau Data Confirm Growth in Homeschooling Amid Pandemic](https://www.educationnext.org/new-u-s-census-bureau-data-confirm-growth-in-homeschooling-amid-pandemic/)
3. [Washington Post - Home schoolingâ€™s rise from fringe to fastest-growing form of education](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2023/homeschooling-growth-data-by-district/?itid=sr_0_256cc5e7-1002-48ce-b7b7-573ea0e674dd)

   All three articles discuss the rates of homeschooling in the context of the pandemic. While the Education Next article claims that the growth of homeschool rates have been as a result of the pandemic, the Johns Hopkins article actually makes the opposite claim. However, all three articles make the claim that homeschool rates have continued to grow since the pandemic. Where the Johns Hopkins article discusses the most common trends across the reporting states, and the general rates throughout the country, the Education Next article talks about specific states that have the highest and lowest rates. The Washington Post article, on the other hand, specifically discusses individual districts across the country, and their rates of homeschooling. All three articles have data from either the Census, individual school districts, or state departments of education.

   Based on these articles, data on homeschooling rates both pre and post pandemic have been looked at, as well as rates of homeschooling in individual states. The articles also covered trends in recent years. Finally, the articles pose conflicting views about the causes of the increase, so we would need to do further research on causes. But what there is no information on, is the reasons parents give for choosing to homeschool their children, and how their thoughts on the subjects have changed in recent years.
