# DC Crime Data: Interesting Question and Answer
## by Caroline Jones

1. My interesting question was: What was the most common type of crime for each shift?
    1. This question is newsworthy for AU's campus because it relates to the saftey of AU students. Answering this question will allow AU students to know what times of day are safest to walk alone around D.C.
2. Steps to answer question / set up pivot table
    1. I put "shift" under "Rows".
    2. I put "offense" under "Columns".
    3. I put "count of offense" under "Values"
3. The answer to my question was that the most common crime commited during each shift was all the same. It was the "theft / other" category. Other interesting findings were that "assult with a dangerous weapon" did not happen during the day, it only happened in the evening or at night. "Motor vehicle theft" happened predominantly during the day.
