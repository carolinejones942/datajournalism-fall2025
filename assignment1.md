# COMM-260 Assignment 1: by Caroline Jones

## Critique of ["Where will the West's next deadly wildfire strike? The risks are everywhere."](https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-wildfires/2019/07/22/wildfire-risks-more-than-500-spots-have-greater-hazard-than-paradise/1434502001/) 

### Clarity & Acuracy

#### Central Insight: Score of 5

*  The central insight was easy to find, as it appeared on its own line at the beginning of the piece. The rest of the data and commentary was built upon this initial insight, using the story of a fire in Paradise, California as a constant.
    *  The central insight was as follows: “Of small communities with fewer than 15,000 households, 526 face a wildfire potential greater than in Paradise.” (Wagner and Larson).
    * As the headline did communicate that “risks are everywhere” (Wagner and Larson), the general idea of the main insight was definitely captured in the headline.

#### Data Visualization: Score of 4

* In general, all of the data visualizations were intuitive and easy to read.
   * The best way to navigate the visualization was to read them as they appeared in the text, as the text did an excellent job of explaining them.
   * Many of the data visualizations included maps of the entire western United States, which was a big area. The size of these maps made it somewhat difficult to take in what data, simply because there was so much data to take in. For improvement of navigation, I would suggest creating the same visualizations, but one for each state to make them less overwhelming. The visualizations could be displayed by a carousel, so that readers can click through to find the specific state they want to look at.

#### Accuracy of Data: Score of 4
* I believe the data in this story was mostly, if not all accurate. I do have a few questions that I would like to clear up.
   * There were no specific areas where I questioned the data's accuracy.
   * Much of the data comes from U.S. Forest Service. I would suggest the reporter check a few with this source to clear up potentially confusing terms and concepts.
   * Yes, the story provided sources for the data within the text.
   * I found some extra explanations to be necessary, as I highlighted above. The data story highlighted U.S. Forest Service as having simulated countless possible fire seasons to assess fire safety. More explanation should have been included to clear up what exactly this means and how it contributes to understanding the data. Still, this story did an excellent job of explaining the criteria for elements that affect the fire safety of an area, including age of the population, evacuation constraints, and ability of a county to digitally alert residents of a fire.
 
### Quality: Score of 5

* This story was certainly executed to a high degree.
   * The story flowed well and had little to no grammatical errors. The writing was captivating and the data was explained and analyzed well. One improvement I would like to highlight is that at some points the explanations were a bit lengthy and this story could have been trimmed up a bit, which would make it tighter.
