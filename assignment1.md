# COMM-260 Assignment 1: by Caroline Jones

## Critique of ["Where will the West's next deadly wildfire strike? The risks are everywhere."](https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-wildfires/2019/07/22/wildfire-risks-more-than-500-spots-have-greater-hazard-than-paradise/1434502001/) 

### Clarity & Acuracy

#### Central Insight: Score of 5

*  The central insight was easy to find, as it appeared on its own line at the beginning of the piece. The rest of the data and commentary was built upon this initial insight, using the story of a fire in Paradise, California as a constant.
    *  The central insight was as follows: “Of small communities with fewer than 15,000 households, 526 face a wildfire potential greater than in Paradise.” (Wagner and Larson).
    * As the headline did communicate that “risks are everywhere” (Wagner and Larson), the general idea of the main insight was definitely captured in the headline.
