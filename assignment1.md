# COMM-260 Assignment 1: by Caroline Jones

## Critique of ["Where will the West's next deadly wildfire strike? The risks are everywhere."](https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-wildfires/2019/07/22/wildfire-risks-more-than-500-spots-have-greater-hazard-than-paradise/1434502001/) 

### Clarity & Acuracy

#### Central Insight: Score of 5

*  The central insight was easy to find, as it appeared on its own line at the beginning of the piece. The rest of the data and commentary was built upon this initial insight, using the story of a fire in Paradise, California as a constant.
    *  The central insight was as follows: “Of small communities with fewer than 15,000 households, 526 face a wildfire potential greater than in Paradise.” (Wagner and Larson).
    * As the headline did communicate that “risks are everywhere” (Wagner and Larson), the general idea of the main insight was definitely captured in the headline.

#### Data Visualization: Score of 4

* In general, all of the data visualizations were intuitive and easy to read.
   * The best way to navigate the visualization was to read them as they appeared in the text, as the text did an excellent job of explaining them.
   * Many of the data visualizations included maps of the entire western United States, which was a big area. The size of these maps made it somewhat difficult to take in what data, simply because there was so much data to take in. For improvement of navigation, I would suggest creating the same visualizations, but one for each state to make them less overwhelming. The visualizations could be displayed by a carousel, so that readers can click through to find the specific state they want to look at.
